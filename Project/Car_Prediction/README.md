# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of used cars using scikit-learn pipelines and custom feature engineering techniques.

## Features
- Feature ratios (e.g., Engine_Liters per Cylinders)
- Log transformation for skewed numeric columns
- Full ML pipeline with preprocessing + model training
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Feature importance analysis

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA)

## Results
- Best model: Random Forest Regressor
- RMSE: ~6,657 (â‰ˆ35% of average car price)
